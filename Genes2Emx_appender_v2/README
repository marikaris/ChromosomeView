This application adds genes to a EMX file with information for the chromosome 6 research.
There is one main class that calls all the others and puts all the information that should
be added to the emx file. This class is AffectedGenes3patientsAppender.
What happens is:
- The attributes table gets more attributes (AttributesTableChanger)
- The genes of the chromosome are added to a new table called genes (GenesTableFiller)
- The geno_ref table gets an extra column with for each genotype,
    the genes that are in the affected region. (GenesToGenoRefAppender)

There is a cli parser that takes two arguments:
-e --emxfile the emx file that should be changed
-g --genefile the gene file that should be read

The genefile should have the columns: gene name, start in bp, stop in bp,
omim morbid description, omim morbid accesion and ensembl id.
The columns in the file should appear in the order that is given above.

The emx file that should be changed should not have the attributes that should be added
already, then the attributes will be added twice. It also should not have a genes sheet,
that will be added twice then, too.

The classes that update the emx file can be called separately too, then the run def should
be changed.
